## About the Project
This project is part of the **final graded assessment** for the back-end development course. It demonstrates the use of **Django** and the **Django REST Framework** to create a web application for the Little Lemon restaurant. The application focuses on handling table bookings through a **REST API** integrated with a **MySQL database**.

The primary goals of this project are to:
- **Connect the Django back-end to MySQL**.
- **Set up a table booking API**.
- **Insert and retrieve booking data via the API**.
- **Implement dynamic front-end functionality using JavaScript**.

---

## Features
- **Static HTML Content**: The application serves static HTML templates using Django.
- **Menu and Booking APIs**: Two endpoints are implemented for managing menu items and table bookings.
- **User Registration and Authentication**: Basic user authentication is included.
- **Database Integration**: MySQL is used as the database for storing bookings and menu data.
- **Unit Tests**: The application includes unit tests to ensure API functionality.
- **API Testing**: The APIs can be tested using the **Insomnia REST Client** or similar tools.
- **Dynamic Front-End**: JavaScript is used to dynamically update the booking interface based on available slots and user input.

## API Endpoints
Here are the primary API paths that can be tested:

| Endpoint                 | Method | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `/api/bookings/`         | GET    | Retrieves all bookings for a specific date. |
| `/api/bookings/`         | POST   | Creates a new booking.               |
| `/api/menu/`             | GET    | Retrieves all menu items.            |
| `/api/menu/`             | POST   | Adds a new menu item (authentication required). |
| `/api/registration/`     | POST   | Registers a new user.                |
| `/api/login/`            | POST   | Authenticates a user.                |
| `/api/logout/`           | POST   | Logs out the current user.           |
